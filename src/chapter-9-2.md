================================================================================================================

Maintaining a self-care practice over time can be challenging, particularly when navigating changes in the workplace and personal life. In this chapter, we'll explore strategies for maintaining a self-care practice during times of transition and stress.

Accepting Change and Prioritizing Self-Care
-------------------------------------------

Accepting that change is a natural part of life and prioritizing self-care during times of transition can help to reduce stress and promote overall well-being. This may involve adjusting your self-care routine to accommodate new responsibilities or changes in your schedule, seeking support from friends or colleagues, or simply taking time to reflect on how you can best care for yourself during times of change.

Planning Ahead
--------------

Planning ahead can also be an effective strategy for maintaining a self-care practice during times of transition or stress. This may involve identifying potential stressors or challenges in advance and developing a plan for how you will address them, building in regular self-care activities to your schedule, or creating a support network that can help you navigate difficult times.

Practicing Flexibility
----------------------

Practicing flexibility is also important when maintaining a self-care practice over time. This may involve being open to trying new self-care activities or approaches, adjusting your self-care routine as needed to accommodate changes in your life, or simply being willing to adapt to new circumstances as they arise.

Setting Realistic Expectations
------------------------------

Setting realistic expectations for yourself during times of transition or stress can help you maintain a self-care practice without feeling overwhelmed or discouraged. This may involve acknowledging that you may not be able to engage in all of your regular self-care activities during times of high stress, or simply being kind and patient with yourself as you adjust to new circumstances.

Conclusion
----------

Maintaining a self-care practice over time requires a commitment to flexibility, adaptability, and self-compassion. By accepting change and prioritizing self-care, planning ahead, practicing flexibility, and setting realistic expectations for yourself during times of transition or stress, you can create a sustainable self-care practice that supports your overall well-being and helps you navigate life's challenges with greater ease and resilience.
